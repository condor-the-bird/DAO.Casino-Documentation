## Brief Operator Checklist
1. Deploy the platform at the local network.
2. Open the administrative panel and enter your settings. Note, that some settings can later be revised, but some are fixed and not subject to change at further stages of platform operation. 
   1. Create the list of Dao-based games to be offered at your platform (can later be edited).
   2. Define your fees.
   3. Provide your wallet details (these will be used by smart contracts at the point of game balance and fee distribution).
3. Transfer data to the IPFS.
4. Edit DNS settings of your website domain to make the IPFS gaming platform available from it (similar to a mirror page).
