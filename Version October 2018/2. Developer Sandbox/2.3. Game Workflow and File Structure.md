## Game Workflow

1. A player calls the `approve` function of an `ERC20` contract allowing the game contract to deposit a specific amount of player funds.
2. Our DCLib is initiated in the player browser by the game `slug` via `dc-messaging` [IPFS Pub Sub](https://github.com/DaoCasino/dc-messaging). It receives requests from available bankrollers and chooses the one with the largest balance to avoid a situation when a bankroller fails to support the  bid.
3. The player front-end application makes a request to the selected bankroller providing data and a private key signature.
4. The  bankroller checks the data and opens the channel.
5. The game contract (muti-sig contract) freezes bankroller and player funds.
6. The player and the bankroller play in an off-chain mode.
7. The player ends the game session.
8. The bankroller checks game data and closes the game channel. The game smart contract unfreezes and distributes funds between the player, the bankroller, the operator, the referrer and the game developer  according to the existing settings.

The file contains basic application logic; implemented both on the client and bankroller side. 

## index.html

Code from this file is executed in a web browser on the gamer side.

Sample of a minimal viable game is available in [dc-cli](https://github.com/DaoCasino/SDK/wiki/2.2.-DC-CLI-and-Dev-Environment) or in DAO.Casino [github repository](https://github.com/DaoCasino/SDK/tree/master/_env/bankroller/dapps/dice_dapp_example).
