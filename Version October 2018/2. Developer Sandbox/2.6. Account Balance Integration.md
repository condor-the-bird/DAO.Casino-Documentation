# Logic

Each player has a unique ID (openkey) that is generated automatically at login.

## Sample ID Configuration

### Index.html

```javascript
<script src="lib/DC.js"></script>
<script>
DCLib.Account.info(function(info){
	console.log(info);
});
</script>
```

### Resulting view

```
balance:
 bet:1.35
 eth:"0.99654064"
 openkey:"0x25909d19236Ec0d9f9061f0b45D97f88BACda7FE"
```

### Implementation

1. Download the latest **DC.js**.
2. Create **index.html** page.
3. Connect this library to the game home page, e.g. `<script src="DC.js"></script>` (see above).
4. Open **index.html** and execute **DCLib.Account.info** in the console.

By default, the page is loaded in demo mode allowing each player to have a test deposit and try different games.
