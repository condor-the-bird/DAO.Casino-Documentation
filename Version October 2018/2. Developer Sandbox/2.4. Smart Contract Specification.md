The Standard SDK contains several `.sol` files (smart contracts) displayed in the contracts folder of the dc-cli console. You can also find them the in [github](https://github.com/DaoCasino/SDK/tree/master/contracts).
## myDappGame.sol
A developer is supposed to partially [myDAppGame.sol](https://github.com/DaoCasino/SDK/blob/master/contracts/myDAppGame.sol) to edit the game "financials":
```javascript
config = Config({

        maxBet: 100 ether,

        minBet: 1,

        gameDevReward: 25,

        bankrollReward: 25,

        platformReward: 25,

        refererReward: 25
```

All amounts are in BET (the coefficient is <a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=ether&space;\times&space;10^{18}" target="_blank"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ether&space;\times&space;10^{18}" title="ether \times 10^{18}" /></a>).

**Warning**: Editing other code blocks is strongly discouraged. Otherwise the whole environment is likely to fail to operate. 

Note that the **game** function is supposed to be as concise as possible to keep the transaction cost low, see also the chapter on [Gas price](https://github.com/DaoCasino/SDK/wiki/2.8.-Notes-on-Transaction-Pricing-(Gas)). 

Numeric values in the above example are [uint265](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/29946/what-is-uint256).

## SafeMath.sol
Implements safe math methods to protect from the risk of [overflow](https://ethereumdev.io/safemath-protect-overflows/).
## Interfaces.sol
Contains methods for interaction with other contracts. 
## OneStepGame.sol
Bankroller core contract that implements methods for [Payment Channel](https://github.com/DaoCasino/SDK/wiki/Payment-Channel-Configuration) integration.

## BlockMinder.sol & Migrations.sol

Used for environment testing.
