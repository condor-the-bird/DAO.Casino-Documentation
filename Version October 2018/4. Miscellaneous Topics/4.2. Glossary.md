| Game channel | When a player and bankroller start a game, the player sends the signed hash, the bankroller checks it and creates transaction to open a channel. When the game begins, player sends game state with a seed (required to apply Signidice algorithm) to the bankroller. Bankroller signs seed and sends it back: that's how the game rolls. Depending on the results, participants refresh the channel state. It can be closed any time. To do this, player sends the last state of the channel to the bankroller with a closure request |
