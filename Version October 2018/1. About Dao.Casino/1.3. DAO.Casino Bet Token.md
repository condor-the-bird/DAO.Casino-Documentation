### Dao.Casino BET Token benefits 

Traditionally, larger players do not introduce in-game tokens operating across all games, as it disrupts the business model. However, in the SME segment, this approach makes sense, as the token eliminates the need to maintain user account balances in each game and, at the same time, makes the token attractive to end players who may have a single aggregated balance in Dao.Casino Bet Token.

Using Ethereum based sub-currency instead of Ether reduces the risk of attacks of rational kind on the system after it scales. If the system is compromised by a malicious actor, the token becomes worthless.
